# AICrevassedetection
1 week school projet at CentraleSupelelec, EI Earth Observation

Code created from the work of Jean Choppin de Janvry https://github.com/JeanCHDJdev/AICreviceDetectionInAntartica

How to use:

  - Install tensorflow environment
  - Install keras
  - Install opencv
Note : directories should be changed according to your computer and to file names.

You can either run on the existing keras model or train your own model with images that do not contains crevices (use Slicer and CAE file to train a auto-encoder model using keras)
